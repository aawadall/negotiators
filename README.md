# negotiators
Simple negotiating agents attempting to reach consensus  

each agent will inspect prior offers, and propose an offer in the environment
currently, agents are using simple curve fitting mechanism

future development, is to inject an objective function, e.g. a function of high amount or low amount and minimum negotiating time
